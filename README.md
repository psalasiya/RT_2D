# RT_2D
This repository contains codes to solve the layer-cake boundary value problem (BVP). See https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmps.2024.105746 for details.
It is capable of using the eigenspectrum generated by QEP_2D package, postprocess it and plot the resulting wavefield. Before running the codes, create a virtual python environment with a Python based FE package, NGSolve as follows:  
1.  Download Python 3.13.7 from https://www.python.org and follow the instructions,
2.  In the terminal, create a directory mkdir and create a virtual environment with the command `python3.13 -m venv name-of-the-environment`,
3.  Activate the directory with source `name-of-the-environment\bin\activate`,
4.  Install ngsolve with `pip install ngsolve`,
5.  Install other dependencies using `pip install matplotlib numpy scipy` and
6.  Check if everything is installed properly by running `netgen`, a ngsolve GUI should open.
   
Once ngsolve is installed succesfully, create two directories: (i) QEP_data and (ii) Matlab_data where data from QEP_2D package and postprocessed data will be stored respectively. Then run the following codes:
1.  Run postprocessing.py. The file is pre-populated relavent parameters. The eigenspectrum will be saved in Matlab_data directory, and
2.  Run BVP1.m to plot the scattered wavefield.
